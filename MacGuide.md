### README

This is my mac. I have loved and cherished this computer for _5 years_ of my life. It has been with me for a longg time. Please take care of it. 

__Things to Note__
* The account login pasword is BubblebubbleP0p
* Your icloud account is daniel.zhang2@icloud.com, password: BubblebubbleP0p2
* If you want to access any apps just Cmd + Space  and type in what you want (e.g. Word)
* On this PC I have installed Microsoft Office suite, but you'll need to sign in with your Office Account

__Additionaly__
You can open the terminal app to run dev commands. I have included python3 and nodejs as starters. With these, you can start to build your own apps like discord. Talk to me if you are interested in using them. 

I have also included VS Code, an app to edit code, git for code source control, and Brew, a MacOS based package manager 


__IMPORTANT__
* __If you want to play games you can do so on this PC as I have installed Minecraft. But I have noticed it's a bit slow. So feel free to use your dad's PC__
#### BUT KEEP YOUR SCHOOL WORK ON THIS PC AND IF YOU WANT TO BRING A COMPUTER TO SCHOOL, BRING THIS ONE. YOUR DAD WILL HAVE SENSITIVE DATA ON HIS PC. IF YOU LOSE HIS PC, YOUR DAD WILL EAT YOU.
